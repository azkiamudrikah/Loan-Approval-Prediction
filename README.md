## Loan Prediction Model 📊  

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on individual financial and demographic data, including salary, total assets, and employment status.  

### Objectives 🎯  
- Build predictive models using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Adaptive Boosting**.  
- Evaluate models using the **ROC-AUC score** to determine the best-performing model for reliable loan risk assessment.  
- Save and deploy the selected model to predict outcomes for new loan applications.  

### Analysis Workflow 🔍  
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding data distribution and identifying key patterns.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.  
3. **Modeling**: Training and testing various machine learning algorithms.  
4. **Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using ROC-AUC scores to select the optimal model.  

### Tools & Libraries 📚  
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn (KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier)  
- **Preprocessing**: MinMaxScaler, OneHotEncoder  
- **Evaluation**: ROC-AUC scoring
